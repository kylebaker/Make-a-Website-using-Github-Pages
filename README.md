# Setup a free Github Pages site

## What you'll need

## Begin with Github

A GitHub account is free. Once an account is made, hit the `+` button on the top right of the screen and make a new repository

When you make a reposity, make sure to name it your username dot github dot io. Since my username is `kylebaker` my repository will be named `kylebaker.github.io`.

## Make an html page

For my use case, I'm choosing to use a very baisc HTML page for several reasons. One, a simple page is easy to load on a bad conneciton, which when sharing your website at conventions, generally have poor internet connections. Two, a basic html page doens't have to be updated for security issues. It shows just what you've designed and doesn't have any funcitonality that you don't need. 

A good template for those that don't know how to make a website is [one provided for free here](http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template). You can download the CV template, unzip it, and edit the files in your editor of choice (I use [sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/)).
